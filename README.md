# Yelp Rating Prediction Project

This repository contains the code used for completing the quarter-long project for the CS224U course at Stanford University.

My friends Tyler Su, Kutay Serova, and I decided to work with the Yelp dataset which contained ~2 million reviews accompanied with a rating between 1 and 5. 

We trained conventional models as well as a novel model and beat the existing work we could find online. You can access our project report a the link below.

The codebase is organized in parts 1-6 for ease of readability.
